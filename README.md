# Project 2 Visualeyes

To get a closer look of the project visit: https://declanboller.github.io/Visualeyes-client-no-react/

The Visualeyes site was produced by 4 students that are part of WDI-30 in sunny
Sydney, Australia. It is a group project that is helping us prepare for our
future web-development rolls. We came together in our shared interest of producing
a site that helps us visualise data in different ways. We chose to focus on
illustrating 15 countries around the world in terms of, population, GDP/per capita,
and life-expectancy.
